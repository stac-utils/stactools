    Accepts an Item and an optional list of asset names within that item, and updates
    the geometry of that Item in-place with the data footprint derived from the first
    of the assets that exists in the Item.

    Two important operations during this calculation are the densification of the
    footprint in the native CRS and simplification of the footprint after reprojection.
    If the initial low-vertex polygon in the native CRS is not densified, this can result
    in a reprojected polygon that does not accurately represent the data footprint. For
    example, a MODIS asset represented by a rectangular 5 point Polygon in a sinusoidal
    projection will reproject to a parallelogram in EPSG 4326, when it would be more
    accurately represented by a polygon with two parallel sides and two curved sides.
    The difference between these representations is even greater the further away from
    the meridian and equator the asset is located.

    After reprojection to EPSG 4326, the footprint may have more points than desired.
    This can be simplified to a polygon with fewer points that maintain a minimum distance
    to the original geometry.

    Args:
        item (Item): The PySTAC Item to extend.
        asset_names (List[str]): The names of the assets for which to attempt to
            extract footprints. The first successful footprint will be used. If the
            list is empty, all assets will be tried until one is successful.
        precision (int): The number of decimal places to include in the coordinates for the
            reprojected geometry.
        densification_factor (Optional[int]): The factor by which to increase point density within
            the polygon.
            A factor of 2 would double the density of points (placing one new point between each
            existing pair
            of points), a factor of 3 would place two points between each point, etc.
        simplify_tolerance (Optional[float]): All points in the simplified object will be within
            the tolerance distance of the original geometry, in degrees.
        no_data(Optional[int]): explicitly set the no data value if not in image metadata
        bands (List[int]): The bands to use to compute the footprint. Defaults
            to [1]. If an empty list is provided, the bands will be ORd together;
            e.g. for a pixel to be outside of the footprint, all bands must have
            nodata in that pixel.
